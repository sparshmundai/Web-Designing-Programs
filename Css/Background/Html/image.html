This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. A verified certificate will attached credibility to the certificate from this course. Also i intend to participate in Dicussion Forums,  which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to be peer reviewed which i believe will be an valuable learning opprtunity.
